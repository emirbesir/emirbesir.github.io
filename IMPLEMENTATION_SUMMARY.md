## 🔐 Security Implementation

✅ API key is stored in GitHub Secrets (not in code)
✅ Key name: `ITCH_API_KEY`
✅ Never committed to repository
✅ Only accessible to GitHub Actions

## 🎯 Next Steps - ACTION REQUIRED!

### 1. Add GitHub Secret (IMPORTANT!)

You MUST add your API key to GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to: https://github.com/emirbesir/emirbesir.github.io/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `ITCH_API_KEY`
4. Value: `Wj2BAsAXHZ5sNCVUYhC6Nw5efCM9AB4V22BOatjD`
5. Click "Add secret"

### 2. Test the Workflow

After adding the secret:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Fetch Itch.io Games"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Wait for completion
5. Check if `data/games.json` was updated

### 3. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Itch.io automation with GitHub Actions"
git push origin main
```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Daily Automatic Updates**
   - Runs at 2 AM UTC every day
   - Fetches all your published games
   - Updates `data/games.json`
   - Commits changes automatically

2. **Manual Updates**
   - Can trigger anytime from Actions tab
   - Useful for testing or immediate updates

3. **Frontend Display**
   - `load-games.js` loads `data/games.json`
   - Creates project cards dynamically
   - Works with existing filters
   - Shows game stats

## 📊 Game Categorization

Games are automatically categorized based on:

- **published**: High downloads/views
- **gamejam**: Title contains "jam"
- **course**: Title contains "course"
- **clone**: Title contains "clone"
- **prototype**: Title contains "prototype" or "tool"

You can customize this in `scripts/fetch-games.js`

## 🧪 Testing Locally (Optional)

```powershell
# Set API key
$env:ITCH_API_KEY = "Wj2BAsAXHZ5sNCVUYhC6Nw5efCM9AB4V22BOatjD"

# Run fetch script
node scripts/fetch-games.js

# Check output
cat data/games.json
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **API Key Security**: Never commit the API key directly in code
2. **Data Tracking**: `data/games.json` should be tracked in git for GitHub Pages
3. **Manual Games**: Old hardcoded games are preserved in hidden section
4. **Browser Cache**: Users might need to refresh to see updates

## 📈 Benefits
