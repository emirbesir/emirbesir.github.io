# Itch.io Games Automation Setup Guide

This portfolio automatically fetches your games from Itch.io daily using GitHub Actions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Your Itch.io API Key to GitHub Secrets

**IMPORTANT:** Your API key is stored securely in GitHub Secrets and will NOT be exposed in the source code.

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/emirbesir/emirbesir.github.io
2. Click on **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Set:
   - **Name:** `ITCH_API_KEY`
   - **Secret:** `Wj2BAsAXHZ5sNCVUYhC6Nw5efCM9AB4V22BOatjD`
6. Click **Add secret**

### 2. How It Works

The automation works in three steps:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/fetch-games.yml`)
   - Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
   - Can also be triggered manually
   - Fetches your games from Itch.io using the API

2. **Fetch Script** (`scripts/fetch-games.js`)
   - Connects to Itch.io API using your secret key
   - Fetches all your published games
   - Automatically categorizes them (published, course, gamejam, clone, prototype)
   - Saves data to `data/games.json`

3. **Display Script** (`scripts/load-games.js`)
   - Loads games from `data/games.json`
   - Dynamically creates project cards
   - Works with your existing filter system

### 3. Manual Trigger

To manually fetch games immediately:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on **Fetch Itch.io Games** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** button
4. Wait a few seconds for it to complete

### 4. Customizing Game Categorization

The script automatically categorizes games based on titles and descriptions. You can customize this in `scripts/fetch-games.js` in the `categorizeGame()` function.

Current logic:
- **gamejam**: Title/description contains "jam"
- **course**: Title/description contains "course"
- **clone**: Title/description contains "clone"
- **prototype**: Title/description contains "prototype" or "tool"
- **published**: Games with significant downloads/views (>10 downloads or >100 views)

### 5. Data Structure

Games are stored in `data/games.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-28T02:00:00.000Z",
  "totalGames": 5,
  "games": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "title": "Game Title",
      "description": "Game description",
      "url": "https://calippooo.itch.io/game-title",
      "coverUrl": "https://img.itch.zone/...",
      "category": "gamejam",
      "technologies": ["Unity", "C#", "2D"],
      "platforms": {
        "windows": true,
        "mac": false,
        "linux": false,
        "android": false
      },
      "stats": {
        "downloads": 50,
        "views": 200
      },
      "published": true,
      "publishedAt": "2024-10-15 12:00:00",
      "createdAt": "2024-10-10 10:00:00",
      "minPrice": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### Games not showing up?
1. Check that the workflow ran successfully in the **Actions** tab
2. Check `data/games.json` to see if it has data
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

#### API errors?
1. Verify the secret is set correctly in GitHub Settings
2. Check that your API key is still valid at https://itch.io/api-keys
3. Look at the workflow logs in the **Actions** tab

#### Want to keep some manual games?
The current hardcoded games have been moved to a hidden section. You can:
1. Keep them in the hidden `manual-projects-grid` div
2. Or manually add them back to `data/games.json`
3. Or modify `scripts/load-games.js` to merge both sources

### 7. Testing Locally

To test the fetch script locally:

```bash
# Set your API key as environment variable
$env:ITCH_API_KEY = "Wj2BAsAXHZ5sNCVUYhC6Nw5efCM9AB4V22BOatjD"

# Run the script
node scripts/fetch-games.js
```

This will create/update `data/games.json` with your games.

## Security Notes

âœ… Your API key is stored securely in GitHub Secrets
âœ… The key is never committed to the repository
âœ… The key is only accessible to GitHub Actions workflows
âœ… The workflow only has read access to the Itch.io API

## Next Steps

After setting up the secret, the automation will:
- âœ… Fetch games daily at 2 AM UTC
- âœ… Update your portfolio automatically
- âœ… Show latest game stats (downloads, views)
- âœ… Work with your existing filter system

Enjoy your automated portfolio! ðŸŽ®
